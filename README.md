## portfolio-flask

I have developed a portfolio web app using Python/Flask and deployed to zeet.co. You can view the deployed version at [mkilicarslan.com](https://mkilicarslan.com).

### Roadmap

- Update works page with my own projects.
- Update other pages with correct informations.
- Use a NoSQL database to store contact form inputs.
- Create an admin panel.
